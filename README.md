# Personal-Projects
Hi! My name is Austin Phillips and I'm a self-taught programmer, pursuing a degree in CIS.

This repo is a work in process since I have recently moved over to GitHub so please pardon the dust! Here you will find all of my projects, which I've used to help develop my programming skills. This includes both personal and work-related projects.
