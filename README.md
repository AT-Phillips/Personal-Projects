# Personal-Projects
Hi! My name is Austin Phillips and I'm a self-taught programmer, pursuing a degree in CIS.

This repo contains all of my personal projects, which I've used to help develop my programming skills. I will add to this repo as I come up with new projects

Disclaimer: Some of these projects are older and have been moved over from a now defunct repo of mine. For the sake of documentation, I've included a comment in the first main file of each project to help determine when I first started that project. This at least gives me an idea of how old a project is.
